The way you move
I can't explain
The mood subsides
And grows again

I lived alone
I felt a hand
I tried to care
And understand

What is fate
And when belief
And who knows how
These things deceive

I never said
Although I tried
If I could leave
And sleep tonight

I can't imagine
How this ever came to be
Can't imagine
How this ever came to be.
