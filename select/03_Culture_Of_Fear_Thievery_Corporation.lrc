[00:05.95] Seems to me like they want us to be afraid, man
[00:08.74] Or maybe we just like being afraid
[00:12.91] Maybe we just so used to it at this point that it's just a part of us
[00:16.63] Part of our culture
[00:18.66] Security alert on orange
[00:21.75] It's been on orange since '01 G,
[00:23.45] I mean what's up man
[00:24.50] Can't a brother get yellow man
[00:26.16] Just for like two months or something
[00:27.50] God damn
[00:29.39] Sick o' that
[00:35.39] 
[00:32.17] Mic check
[00:36.67] 
[00:33.49] The groove is dead so I'm a rhyme like a lunatic
[00:36.27] I do this shit with an unassuming wit
[00:38.32] The corporation conjured up the bass and the tempo
[00:41.12] My name is Liff, that's the intro, now let's go
[01:04.62] 
[00:43.87] The flow of life throwing strife into the mix
[00:46.26] The big dark condition and the word is sick
[00:48.84] The powers that be
[00:49.56] A power in me
[00:50.51] To speak a cause
[00:51.26] Stress and strife that I see every day
[00:53.08] And more to speak upon
[00:54.06] It's up in your ear
[00:55.95] They're telling us terrorists about to strike
[00:58.33] May be tonight
[00:59.34] Right
[01:00.00] Let me just back up slowly
[01:01.98] With critical analysis of those who control me
[01:04.64] It used to be we just had a screen in the crib
[01:06.79] On the TV
[01:07.33] But now we carry screens when we leave see
[01:09.58] Laptops smart phones now we're never alone
[01:12.21] A new affliction I call it media dome
[01:14.56] But on the road famine is the programming
[01:17.15] You want to watch a favorite show because it's so slamming
[01:19.66] Hold hands and let's gaze into the beautiful glare
[01:22.22] While we're here so immersed in this culture of fear
[01:48.22] 
[02:03.75] We fear the IRS, fear the INS
[02:05.33] Fear God
[02:06.02] I'm more afraid of the planet [...] than the terror squad
[02:08.74] Weapons overseas
[02:11.50] Mastercard and visa want to buy me the greed
[02:13.80] They deceive
[02:14.41] The enemy is in the fine print
[02:16.62] They assassinate sally
[02:18.13] With no sense of the selling
[02:19.40] [...]represent an element ahead
[02:26.78] A sentiment that you feel on the road for real
[02:29.48] The deal starts with a spark concludes with a hand shake
[02:32.26] Physical to alter the subliminal landscape
[02:34.70] Relief thinking I can really trust that guy
[02:37.24] To be honest could have should have really punched that guy
[02:39.44] Now it's operation shank a banker
[02:41.46] Thank you for the loan
[02:42.89] See you when you come to repossess my home
[02:44.78] Alone at night sweating with visions of Armageddon
[02:47.60] I never seen the threat
[02:49.09] Yet I feel threatened
[02:50.36] Parts of our society designed to smear
[02:52.54] Freedom don't succumb to this culture of fear
[02:55.39] Fear fear fear
[02:58.69] Don't succumb to this culture of fear
[03:00.23] Fear fear fear
[03:03.70] Don't succumb to this culture of fear
