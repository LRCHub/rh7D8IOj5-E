It's a dead world...
And it's about that time to clear things here!
One generation follows another...
But something in my head says:
Keep going! don't give up!

Cold sweat - running down my back!
I don't fear the chaos!
A reason to fight is not making a stronger man
Cause they don't understand!
I won't calm down! I won't calm down!
What am I supposed to do?
It's hard to realize that the time is running out!
Pow! we're on the move! resist worldwide!
Cause it takes two...
Your money is full of blood and I know this for sure -
We're gonna take over!
Radical! terrorize! and I'm not gonna tell you lies!
Our chances are low - too many problems we got!
F**k the police! blow them out!

Destroy 2000 years of culture! destroy 2000 years of culture! (move! we gotta move! move! we gotta move!) Move! I shout it out loud!
We're radical and we're proud of it...

Change the things - together we stand and load the gun and make 'em swing'!
Love is a wonderful thing - a secret - a game
And I sing the song of freedom to hate!
Try to think international!

Destroy 2000 years of culture! destroy 2000 years of culture!
Destroy!
Destroy 2000 years of culture! destroy! destroy! Destroy 200 years of culture! (move! we gotta move! move! we gotta move!) Destroy 2000 years

Your freedom to speak is a freedom to lie
Whatever it takes to change . I'm up for it!
There's no place where noone gets hurt...
A place where I can be on my own!
You should feel guilty if you're just watching!
There's this pain and a constant sound in my head...
They always try and get you back to what they define as reality!
There's nothing to lose but watch your back!
It's cold out here... (don't wait too long!)

Destroy 2000 years of culture! destroy! destroy! (move! we gotta move! move! we gotta move!) Destroy 2000 years of culture! destroy 2000 years of culture!
